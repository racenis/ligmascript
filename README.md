# LIGMAScript

![LIGMAScript logo](/docs/ligma_logo_spacious.gif)

Very good programming language. The name stands for **LI**st **G**eneral **M**anipulation and **A**rithmetic **Script**. You can read more about it on the [github.io page](https://racenis.github.io/ligmascript/). 

## Example

#### Hello world

```
"hellow wworld uwu ;33" print 
```

#### Is Impressive

```
is-impressive (lambda
	100 > if (
		"yes, it's an impressive" print
	) else (
		"no, it's not impressive at all" print
	)
) set

; Since the language doesn't have any standard way to get command
; line input, you'd have to load it into the interpreter in the
; REPL mode and then you could call the is-impressive subroutine
; like this:

150 is-impressive 
```
