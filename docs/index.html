				<h2>LIGMAScript Programming Language</h2>
			</center>

			<p>
				<b>LIGMAScript</b> (pronounced ligmascript) is a <i>blazingly</i> 
				fast, structured, imperative, procedural, non-object-oriented, 
				non-functional functional, general purpouse, compiled, byte-code 
				interpreted digital computer programming language for programming 
				digital computers.
			</p>

			<p>
				It's currently being worked on, and when finished it will be the 
				best programming language ever.

			<h3>What's a LIGMAScript?</h3>
			<p>
				<b>LIGMAScript</b> stands for <b>L</b>ist <b>I</b>nterpreted 
				<!-- <b>LI</b>st --> <b>G</b>eneral <b>M</b>anipulation and 
				<b>A</b>rithmetic <b>Script</b>.
			</p>

			<h3>Why LIMGAScript</h3>
			<h4>Dynamical types</h4>
			<p>
				Declaring types for variables is super-annoying, so why bother? 
				The LIGMAScript is designed without any type declarations for 
				this reason. 
				This also means that you don't have to write a subroutine for 
				each type or use stinky hacks like 'the generics' as they are 
				called in other languages. Just write one subroutine, and it 
				will work with any values that it may touch.
			</p>
			<h4>No Functions</h4>
			<p>
				It's really hard to come up for names for functions and then you 
				need to pass parameters, and then decide what value the function 
				is going to return and so on and so forth. For this reason the 
				LIGMAScript language does not have any functions.
				<a href="#note-no-functions"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
			</p>
			<h4>Performance</h4>
			<p>
				LIGMAScript is a compiled, whych automaticcally means that it is 
				also very fast, but compiling straight to machine-code 
				compromises the squishiness of the langauge, so LIGMAScript is 
				compiled to bytecode and then intepreted by the LIGMAScript 
				Virtual Machine (LIGMASVM for short).
			</p>
			<h4>Reliabilty</h4>
			<p>
				LIGMAScript Virtual Machine is designed in such a way that it 
				doesn't crash (and when it does it's always intentional). 
				The VM also prevents memory leaks, by collecting the garbage
				(reference counted, for maximum speed)
			</p>
			<p>
				LIGMAScript VM implements an innovative memory model which 
				consists of one very large array. This 
				ensures zero memory fragmentation. Supports up to 65000
				different values (you will not need more).
			</p>

			<h3>Syntax</h3>
			<p>
				The most notable syntactical feature of the language is that it 
				uses lithuanian notation. This means that two compute the sum of 
				two two's instead of writing <code>2 + 2</code>, as in other 
				languages, you'd write <code>2 2 +</code>.
				The language also doesn't use squirly bracelets (like the 
				<code>{</code> and also the <code>}</code>) for blocks.
				There are only 489 <a href="#note-keyword-count"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
				keywords in LIGMAScript. These can be learned in a single afternoon.
			</p>

			<h4>Hello World</h4>
			<code>
				"hello world" . cr
			</code>

			<h4>Is Impressive</h4>
			<code>
				is-impressive (lambda<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;100 > if (<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"yes, it's an impressive" . cr<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;) else (<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"no, it's not impressive at all" . cr<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;)<br/>
				) set<br/><br/>
				; Since the language doesn't have any standard way to get command line input,<br/>
				; you'd have to load it into the interpreter in the REPL mode and then you could<br/>
				; call the is-impressive subroutine like this:<br/><br/>
				150 is-impressive
			</code>

			<h3>How to achieve the LIGMAScript</h3>
			<p>
				There's is still no very large release, but it's possible to 
				access the source code of the LIGMAScript on the 
				<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/racenis/ligmascript">github.com</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				To use the LIGMAScript, simply compile it. The main.cpp has a 
				simple runtime, but ideally you'd compile without main() and 
				instead would embed the VM in an application.
			</p>

				<li id="note-best-lang">
					It already is.
				</li>
				<li id="note-no-functions">
					We lied. LIGMAScript has lots of functions. That's why 
					it's called a functional language.
