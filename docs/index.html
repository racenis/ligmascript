				<h2>LIGMAScript Programming Language</h2>
			</center>

			<p>
				<b>LIGMAScript</b> (pronounced ligmascript) is a <i>blazingly</i> fast structured imperative non-functional non-object-oriented procedural functional general purpouse compiled byte-code interpreted programming language for programming programs.
			</p>

			<p>
				It's currently being worked on, and when finished it will be the best programming language ever.
			</p>

			<h3>What's a LIGMAScript?</h3>
			<p>
				LIGMAScript stands for <!-- <b>L</b>ist <b>I</b>nterpreted --> <b>LI</b>st <b>G</b>eneral <b>M</b>anipulation and <b>A</b>rithmetic <b>Script</b>.
			</p>

			<h3>Why LIMGAScript</h3>
			<h4>No Types</h4>
			<p>
				Declaring types for variables is super-annoying, so why bother? The LIGMAScript is designed without any types for this reason. This also means that you don't
				have to write a subroutine for each type or use stinky hacks like 'the generics' as they are called in other languages. Just write one subroutine, and it will
				work with any values that it may touch.
			</p>
			<h4>No Functions</h4>
			<p>
				It's really hard to come up for names for functions and then you need to pass parameters, and then decide what value the function is going to return and so on and so forth.
				For this reason the LIGMAScript language does not have any functions.
			</p>
			<h4>Performance</h4>
			<p>
				LIGMAScript is a compiled, whych automaticcally means that it is also very fast, but compiling straight to machine-code compromises the squishiness of the langauge, so
				LIGMAScript is compiled to bytecode and then intepreted by the LIGMAScript Virtual Machine (LIGMASVM for short).
			</p>
			<h4>Reliabilty</h4>
			<p>
				LIGMAScript Virtual Machine is designed in such a way that it doesn't crash (and when it does it's always intentional). The VM also prevents memory leaks, by collecting the garbage, but the garbage collection is optional and if you want you can leak some memory.
			</p>

			<h3>Syntax</h3>
			<p>
				The most notable syntactical feature of the language is that it uses lithuanian notation. This means that two compute the sum of two two's instead of writing <code>2 + 2</code>, as in other languages, you'd write <code>2 2 +</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The language also doesn't use squirly bracelets (like the <code>{</code> and also the <code>}</code>) for blocks.
			</p>

			<h4>Hello World</h4>
			<code>
				"hellow wworld uwu ;33" print
			</code>

			<h4>Is Impressive</h4>
			<code>
				is-impressive (lambda<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;100 > if (<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"yes, it's an impressive" print<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;) else (<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"no, it's not impressive at all" print<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;)<br/>
				) set<br/><br/>
				; Since the language doesn't have any standard way to get command line input,<br/>
				; you'd have to load it into the interpreter in the REPL mode and then you could<br/>
				; call the is-impressive subroutine like this:<br/><br/>
				150 is-impressive
			</code>

			<h3>Stuff that still isn't done</h3>
			<p>
				There are still some things that need to be done in the LIGMAScript:
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Finish the LIGMAScript language.
						<ul>
							<li>
								It still needs a few more features:
								<ul>
									<li>accessing a single value from a vector</li>
									<li>string manipulation</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Actually test the compiler
						<ul>
							<li>It is programmed in a way that it assumes that all of the code it receives is correct.</li>
							<li>But sometimes it is not so, and it will crash.</li>
							<li>So that means that the compiler should be made so that it doesn't crash.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>How to achieve the LIGMAScript</h3>
				<p>
					There's is still no very large release, but it's possible to access the source code of the LIGMAScript on the <a href="https://github.com/racenis/ligmascript">github.com</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					To use the LIGMAScript, simply compile it. The main.cpp has some example usage.
