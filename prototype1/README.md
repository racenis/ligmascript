# First LIGMAScript prototype

This is the first LIGMAScript prototype.

I yeeted it because working in C is a bit annoying. Also before I got to
implement all of the compiler/interpreter features, the code quality had
deteriorated to the point where making any progress without a lot of refactoring
would have been very time consuming.

Maybe when I finish the language and if I really don't have anything to do,
I could, perhaps, rewrite the interpreter part of the library in C. That way
it might be a little bit faster.
